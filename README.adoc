= What does this application do?
This is a Python implementation for implementing K-means classifier as a learning exercise.

== What is the problem statement?
Given a toy dataset with the following code:
```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import style
X=np.array([[2, 4],
            [1.7, 2.8],
            [7, 8],
            [8.6, 8],
            [3.4, 1.5],
            [9,11]])
plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1], s=150)
plt.show()
```

The ask is to build a K-means while trying to classify the toy dataset into 2 clusters and output the classification results.
Note: Try to use seaborn/matplotlib library to visualize the final classification results.
